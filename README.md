# GPicture

Small project for me it's like a Gallery based on Flickr API with features to make a link of photos with Instagram (really specific description with keyword to match the photo with flickr)
The code is **really messy** and **really not optimized** so, only use it for personal usage if you really like it ^^
(I will update sometimes this project to fix bugs/add features)
